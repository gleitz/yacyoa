YASC: Yet Another Southwest Checkin
========================

A Python script for automatically checking into Southwest flights. Works as of November 2012.

Usage:

`checkin.py <FIRSTNAME> <LASTNAME> <CONFIRMATIONNUMBER> (<EMAIL>)`

Extra notes:

*   Requires the excellent [Requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/)
*   You may optionally provide an email address to send the boarding pass. If you do put your gmail username and password in a file called secret.txt separated by a double pipe character (e.g. `yourname@gmail.com||password`) and then run `chmod 600 secret.txt`
*   Southwest likes to change their login process rather regularly so YMMV.
